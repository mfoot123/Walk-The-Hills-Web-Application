# Sprint x Report (8/26/21 - 9/24/2021)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Google Maps API Navigation Integration
 * Get new Route
 * Autofill search assistance
 * Elevation gain display

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Sprint one was focused on designing a strong framework for future tasks. Building this framework was difficult in the face of change specifications and requirements. Each week as we learned more about the changing needs of the client we were forced to reassess the framework and design choices we made. This process caused us to scrap and restart the building process a few times. This helped us create a design that is built for change. Through this we were able to implement a more fluid google maps integration and a stronger and more robust UI. This UI improvement has led to additional roadblocks that will need to be addressed. It became very clear that one group member was struggling with the level of complexity of the project while the project also struggled to maintain a cross platform functionality. The first of these problems is being addressed through a performance plan (see below). The second has been moved to be addressed in a future sprint as cross platform behaviors becomes the focus of a more functional test group. This project has the framework developed and the introductory code that will build the foundations of all future work. 

## Unfinished Work
Two main issues were not completed. One was a bug report that issued a no navigation possibility flag seen only using the firefox web browser. For now this behavior has been moved to a future sprint where we will address all cross platforming concerns as more are sure to rise in the development of this project. The second is create an effective clear function for existing routes. Ideally a navigational route will clear when a user wants to search for a new route, but this function is not yet complete. JJ was working on this task as his first and one of only 2 minor tasks assigned to him. On his own branch we can see some progress which allows some clearing to be completed, but the function remains unable to clear the initial navigation a user makes. JJ also made the readme updates. Given the size and scope of the issue it was left to JJ alone to complete the tasks as other tasks were handled and handed out. The slow progress on the task has led  us to creating an improvement plan for JJ in future sprints to ensure a larger section of work can be handled by him.

Please note: Due to management requirements and other time setbacks, it was not identified that formal PR documentation through GitHub would be required until after commits and pushes were done through in person only review panels. These review panels did not form formals PRs to link in GitHub. All future Sprints will tie PRs in GitHub to the actual issue's resolution PR.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Client Requirements have finally been summarized in full
  * Architectural and function design and framework have been drawn up
  * Foundations for future development are in place to ease project development in the future. Designed for change.
  * Research on new language and new API integration have returned exception results for integration.
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Look ahead at the sprint report and other documentation to ensure we follow the defied format of future assignments in our working process. 
   * A stronger division of labor is needed to enhance development speed.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * JJ will start working earlier and seek help from our mentor in addition to team members
   * Project will be divided into two major components to allow co-development between Mitch and Adam with JJ supporting both.
   * Formal PR and code reviews through the GitHub environment will be held instead of in person meetings to meet course requirements.
